//When I open the planner, the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
$(document).ready(function() {
//This function needs to call server to update time and date to show ://WHEN I view the time blocks for that day, each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
  })

//WHEN I scroll down, I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours
//08-4pm this is the bootstrap part 


//WHEN I click into a time block, then I can enter an event
//event listener and save user input 

//WHEN I click the save button for that time block, the text for that event is saved in local storage
//is this a console log?

//WHEN I refresh the page, the saved events persist
//append user input to display within the event description
